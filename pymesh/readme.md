# For reference only

This library is the open-source part of the Pymesh LoRa Firmware which can be provisioned through Pybytes and cannot be used as stand-alone on a Pybytes or Pygate type firmware. Please check the [Pycom Documentation](https://docs.pycom.io/pybytes/pymeshintegration/provisioning/) on how to get Pymesh type firmware provisioned to your device. You will not have to use this library in your project or flash it to your device separately, as it is already included in the firmware.
